### Why Japanese Websites Look So Different & How to Analyze Design Choices Without Jumping to Conclusions

Over the years, I have had many encounters with Japanese websites—be it researching visa requirements, planning trips, or simply ordering something online. It took me a long time to get used to the walls of text, lavish use of bright colors, and 10+ different fonts that sites like these often display. While there are many examples of more minimalistic and easy-to-navigate designs for someone used to Western websites, it is worth examining why this more convoluted style remains prevalent in Japan.

And just to be clear, these are not remnants from the past but maintained sites that—in many cases—were last updated in 2023.

#### Fonts & Front-End Website Development Constraints

Creating new fonts for Romanized languages can be an enjoyable challenge that anyone with a basic understanding of typography, an appropriate program, and some time on their hands can take on. However, doing the same for Japanese is an endeavor on a whole other level. To create a font from scratch in English, you’ll be looking at around 230 glyphs—a glyph being a single representation of a given letter (A a a counting as 3 glyphs)—or 840 glyphs if you want to cover all languages based on the Latin alphabet. For Japanese, as a result of the three different writing systems and countless Kanji, you will easily be looking at 7,000–16,000 glyphs or even more. So, creating a new font in Japanese requires both an organized team effort and a lot more time than its Latin counterparts.

It won’t come as a surprise then that similar workloads ensue for Chinese and (Hanja) Korean fonts, leading to these languages being often covered in what are called CJK fonts.

With fewer designers rising to this particular challenge, there are fewer fonts to choose from when building a website. Add this to the lack of capitalization and Japanese fonts being accompanied by longer loading times due to referencing larger libraries, and you end up having to use different means to create visual hierarchy.

Let’s take the American & Japanese versions of the Starbucks homepage as an example: Japanese websites tend to represent content categories with text-heavy images. You’ll sometimes even see each tile using its own bespoke typeface, especially when it’s a limited-time offer.

#### Technological Development/Stagnation & Institutional Digital Literacy

Despite countless discussions of the “Lost Decades” and Japan’s relationship with technological advancements, I like this summary the best: If you harbor an interest in Japan, you might be familiar with the at-times striking dichotomy between state-of-the-art and utterly obsolete technology that are juxtaposed in many places. One of the world leaders in robotics—the country that put a life-sized Gundam statue on the artificial island of Odaiba—is also one of the top leaders in still relying on floppy disks and fax machines, panicking in the face of the Windows Explorer shutdown in 2022.

In Germany, former chancellor Angela Merkel was made fun of nationwide after she called the internet “uncharted territory” in 2013. This was easily topped by former cybersecurity minister Yoshida Sakurada, who, in 2018, claimed to have never once used a computer and was—confused by the concept of a USB drive when asked in parliament.

As strange as it might sound for someone who hasn’t yet had the chance to look behind the curtain of illusions, Japan is—and has been—severely lagging behind its update schedule when it comes to technological literacy. Thus, it isn’t far-fetched to infer that these issues also played a part in holding back Japanese website design. And it is, specifically, Japanese web design that faces this struggle—just search up Japanese poster design on Google or Pinterest to witness a very different and contemporary level of graphic design.

#### Cultural Influence

Cultural customs, inclinations, biases, and preferences shouldn’t be underestimated when analyzing design choices of any kind. Still, “it’s culture” runs the risk of oversimplifying the topic and being used as an excuse to justify all sorts of differences. And to shed one's own perspective bias is tricky and perhaps not even fully possible.

So, from our point of view, it’s easy to look at this website and see a cluttered, overwhelming design. And that’s where interesting insights get flushed down the toilet because of ignorance. Now, I am not in the place to tell you exactly how Japanese culture has influenced this kind of design. However, I am in the fortunate position to be able to draw from conversations with Japanese natives, as well as experience from working in Japan and having lived in the country.

One conversation I had that relates to this analysis was actually not about websites, but YouTube thumbnails—which, at times, can be equally overwhelming. For someone used to the minimalistic and sleek design many Western channels use—featuring one title, recurring color palettes, and limited fonts—the above thumbnail is a lot to take in. The Japanese native I asked about why many thumbnails of hugely popular channels were designed this way, however, was surprised about the idea of this design being seen as confusing. He felt that the Japanese approach made the videos seem more intriguing, giving several tidbits of information to latch onto, in turn rendering it easy to make an informed decision on whether the video would be interesting. The English video thumbnails I showed him as a comparison, on the other hand, felt extremely vague and boring to him.

And it might be exactly this information-seeking attitude that is the root cause of our perceptions diverging so much. In Japan, the level of risk-aversion, double-checking, and hesitancy towards making quick decisions is noticeably higher than in Western countries. This is tightly connected to the more collectivist social mindset—for instance, double (or triple) checking a document before sending it to a business partner might take a bit longer but poses a significantly lower risk of errors slipping through, thus preventing anyone involved from losing face.

Though there is an argument to be made that this only holds true for sufficiently high stakes, which confusing foreign tourists appears not to qualify as—search up the term “Engrish” & thank me later.

Back to website design and this cultural angle helps to explain why online shopping, news, and governmental websites are often the “worst offenders” from an outside perspective. After all, these are exactly the cases in which a high amount of details directly corresponds with making a good purchase decision, staying up-to-date efficiently, or making sure you have all the necessary information about a certain procedure.

Interestingly, there’s also a considerable body of research about how differently Americans and Japanese perceive information. Results from several studies seem to show that Japanese, for instance, perceive information more holistically, whereas Americans tend to pick one focal point to direct their attention towards. This may give us another hint at why Westerners have a difficult time with these types of websites even at a high level of Japanese language proficiency.

Last but not least, it needs to be said that websites don’t exist in an online vacuum. With various media ranging from pamphlets or magazines to advertisements in the metro also using layouts that cram as much information into as little space as possible, people may simply be so used to this ubiquitous approach that nobody ever thought of questioning it.

To make a long story short, this is neither an attempt to find the absolute answer to the title question nor to reinforce the notion that the Japanese are unique à la nihonjinron (日本人論). Instead, especially after having seen several discussions that focused on one explanation as the “true answer,” I wanted to show the bandwidth of technological, historical, and cultural influences that ultimately shape such differences.
